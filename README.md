Titanic Dataset - Machine Learning Project

Introduction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. It involves data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes details like passenger class, sex, age, ticket fare, and survival outcome. The goal is to develop a model that predicts survival probabilities.

Project Steps

1. Data Exploration

Load dataset using Pandas

Identify missing values

Visualize distributions using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Analyze feature correlations

2. Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (e.g., impute missing ages)

Encode categorical variables (e.g., convert â€˜Sexâ€™ to numerical values)

Scale numerical features for better model performance

3. Model Building

Various machine learning models are used, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting

4. Model Evaluation

Performance is assessed using:

Confusion matrix

ROC curve & AUC score

Cross-validation

Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-project.git

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook or script:

jupyter notebook titanic_analysis.ipynb

Results

The project demonstrates how machine learning models can predict survival with reasonable accuracy. Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning can further improve results.
